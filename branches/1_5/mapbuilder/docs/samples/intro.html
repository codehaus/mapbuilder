<h2>Sample pages</h2>

The following pages show a few examples of how Mapbuilder can be configured 
in various ways and how it can support different models.
Details about how the configuration file can be found in the 
<a href="?page=config/config">configuration section of this user guide</a>.

You can look at the configuration document by clicking on the "config file" 
link at the top of the page.
Similarly, you can see the basic HTML for the page (just the main page body,
without all the page surround)
by clicking on the "view source" link.
