<h2>GeoServer and other OGC Web Services</h2>

<p>
Some of the Mapbuilder demos depend on having 
<a href="http://geoserver.sourceforge.net/">GeoServer</a> installed as a 
transactional Web Feature Server (WFS).
Please refer to it's installation documentation for how to install it, 
but it can be installed in the same servlet container as Mapbuilder.
</p>

<p>
Being based on standards, other OGC web services can be used as data
sources in a local installation, including Open source projects 
<a href="">Mapserver</a> and <a href="">Deegree</a>, as well as various
commercial implementations of the OGC web service specifications.
