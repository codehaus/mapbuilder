<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Mapbuilder is an open source project that implements a framework
dynamic web page content from XML documents.
The techniques used by this package are now being called 
<a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">AJAX</a> 
which is shorthand for Asynchronous JavaScript + XML.
</p>

<p>
Mapbuilder consists of a JavaScript library that 
implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern.
The model, view and controller objects to be used in the web page are configured
in an XML configuration file.
The schema of the configuration file is derived from RDF and is fully described 
in the <a href="?page=config/config">mapbuilder configuration documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
This User Guide explains how to configure and link Mapbuilder components into a web page.
Several different Mapbuilder configurations will be demonstrated along with some
ideas for how to include it in the web page layout.
The target audience for this tutorial is those tasked with implementing an 
application in HTML and have a basic understanding of HTML, XML and Javascript.
Developer's seeking to extend or modify the code-base should consult 
the mapbuilder <a href="?page=reference#mapbuilder">design documentation.</a> 
</p>

<p>
One design goal of mapbuilder is to let page designers do page layout
and design, and simply link in mapbuilder JavaScript code using HTML element IDs. 
Being a JavaScript implementation, CSS and DHTML techniques are then used for
manipulating these elements.
</p>

<p>
Mapbuilder was originally conceived to render 
<a href="?page=reference#ogc">Web Map Context documents</a> 
to create interactive mapping applications on the web.
However the modular design framework
allows mapbuilder to be extended to handle almost any XML document type.

<p>
The tutorial starts with the common steps required to code a mapbuilder
application.
