This file contains information about updates to each release:

gmlviewer-1.0
=============
This is the first official release of the gmlviewer developed for the
OGC's OWS4 testbed by Thales Australia.

It is derived from:
* version 2422 of the trunk version of Mapbuilder, soon to be
  mapbuilder-lib-1.5-rc1
  URL: https://svn.codehaus.org/mapbuilder/trunk/mapbuilder/mapbuilder
* version 2036 of the sandbox/vector branch of OpenLayers,
  URL: http://svn.openlayers.org/sandbox/vector

The application is very similar to the mapbuilder/demo/openlayers/index.html
demo and will be maintained in that demo directory in the future.
