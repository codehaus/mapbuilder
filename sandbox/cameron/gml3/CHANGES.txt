Mapbuilder Open Source GML Viewer
=================================
This file contains information about updates to each release:

mapbuilder-ows4-draft3
======================
In this release, Mapbuilder is now using http://openlayers.org for its
rendering engine. This provides:
* Faster vector rendering in Internet Explorer
* Faster rendering on pan/zoom as the GML is only passed on startup
* Base WMS maps are available using tiles (still waiting on a WMS which
  supports the MSD3 dataset projection).

mapbuilder-ows4-draft2
======================
This release also includes vector rendering in IE 6.0 using VML. This has significant performance problems for large datasets. Rendering the entire MSD3 dataset takes around 10 minutes.

mapbuilder-ows4-draft1
======================
This draft Mapbuilder release provides rendering of GML3 inside a web browser. This demonstrates that a dataset the size of MSD3 can be rendered in a web browser using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
