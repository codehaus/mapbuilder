 
<h2>Sources for maps</h2>

<p>
All maps used in mapbuilder are from OGC 
<a href="?page=reference#ogc">Web Map Context documents.</a>
A context document provides an interoperable way of storing and sharing 
maps created using the various OGC web service specfications
</p>

<p>
Sources for these maps:
<ul>
  <li><span class="title">Create your own:</span>
  Use a text or XML editor to add and delete layers to an existing or new 
  context document. 
  This method is tedious and difficutl but can be used for simple changes.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">owsview:</span>
  Currently, the best application for creating a context document is 
  <a href="http://cgdi-dev.geoconnections.org/prototypes/owsview/index.html" target="GetContext">owsview.</a>
  Functions include adding layers by browsing WMS capabilities doc and loading
  and saving context documents.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Search the GeoConnections Discovery Portal:</span>
  The Discovery Portal offers a 
  <a href="http://geodiscover.cgdi.ca/ceonetWeb/doc?dispatchServlet=/biz&servletName=bizServlet&service=searchForWebServiceData" target="GetContext">
  web service search</a> function which will 
  dynamically generate a context document based on search parameters.
  The limitiations of this method are that it depends on the web service
  providing good metadata in the capabilities document and a slow response of the 
  search engine.
  Look for improvments to this service as new registry technology is implemented.
  </li>
</ul>
