<h2>Multiple models</h2>


<div style="float:right;width:auto; padding: 4px">
  <div id="firstMapPane"></div>
</div>

<p>
  This example includes two different maps that both have a MapPane widget
  as well as an Area of Interest (AOI) widgets which displays an AOI for the model.
  The AOI can either be a 
<a href="javascript:alert('hover over this link to see the AOI')" 
      onmouseover="javascript:config.objects['firstMap'].setParam('aoi', new Array(new Array(-75,45),new Array(0,0)))"> 
    rectangular bounding box
  </a>
  or a 
  <a href="javascript:alert('hover over this link to see the AOI')" 
      onmouseover="config.objects['firstMap'].setParam('aoi', new Array(new Array(0,0),new Array(0,0)))">single point.</a>
  The colour, line width and size of point display are customized in the config
  file.
  These links also demonstrate how to reference Mapbuilder objects using 
  the 'config.objects' array, as well as calling a model listener function.
</p>

<div id="secondMapPane" style="float: left; width: auto; padding: 4px"></div>

<p>
  A map can also have some interactive functionality by adding tools 
  (controllers) to the Context document model.
  In this case the secondMap has a tool to handle mouse events on the 
  MapPane widget, as well as a tool to control the firstMap by
  using the 'targetModel' property.  
  <b>Click</b>, or <b>click and drag</b> out an AOI box on the second map 
  to control the area displayed in the firstMap.
