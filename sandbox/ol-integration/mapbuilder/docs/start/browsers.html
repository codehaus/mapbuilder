 
<h2>Browser support</h2>

<p>
Mapbuilder retrieves XML documents to be stored and manipulated within the
browser.  
The documents are rendered into HTML using XSL stylesheets and added to the 
page using the browser's DOM implementation.
Using these techniques provides great flexibility in programing the page 
however it means that only modern browsers are supported.
