 
<h2>Server requirements</h2>

<p>
While the design philosphy of mapbuilder is to minimize server requirements,
there are some cases where you have to modify your server configuration or
provide server CGI/script processing.
<ul>
  <li><span class="title">Proxy script:</span>
    By default, you can only load XML documents served from a server in
    the same domain as your web page.
    If you want to be able to load XML documents from anywhere on the Internet, 
    you will have to install a proxy loader script on your server to make it 
    look like these documents come from your domain.  
    Implementations of this script for the PHP and J2EE server environments 
    are available in the mapbuilder distribution in /mapbuilder/server subdirectory.
    The URL to this script must be set as the &lt;proxyUrl&gt; property in the
    configuration file.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Serialize script:</span>
    If the application wants to save data to back to a server, there must be 
    something on the server preapred to receive that data.  
    An XML serializer script provides this functionality that takes the 
    body of an HTTP POST request and writes it to disk.
    Implementations of this script for the PHP (to be completed) and
    J2EE server environments are available in the mapbuilder distribution in 
    /mapbuilder/server subdirectory.
    In a tomcat environment, the directory in which the XML is written is 
    configured in the deployment descriptor (web.xml).
    The URL to this script must be set as the &lt;serializeUrl&gt; property in the
    configuration file.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">XML mime types:</span>
    The XML documents you retrieve must have a mime type of "text/xml".
    File types that typically aren't served with that mime type include 
    context documents (.cml), collections (.ccml) 
    and often XSL files as well (.xsl).
    Check that the mime type mapping file for your server contains a line like:
    <pre>text/xml      xml xsl cml ccml</pre>
    If you are using Apache, this file will be specified in the httpd.conf.
  </li>
</ul>
