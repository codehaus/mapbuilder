!3 Core fixtures in flow
A fixture may be named in later tables in a sequence of tables, and is handled in the usual way for core fixtures.
!3 Flow fixtures not in flow
If the fixture named in the first table is not a !-DoFixture-! (or !-SequenceFixture-!), the tables are handled in the usual way for core tables. ''!-DoFixture-!''s can still be used in this case.
