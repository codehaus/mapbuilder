This is just a beginning...
 * ^HowTo
!3 Introduction to ''!-FitLibrary-!''
The ''!-FitLibrary-!'' consists of several fixtures that work together.  There are several interesting features of the ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures:
 * ^DoFixture tables are compact and flexible for writing workflow tests
 * The fixtures can operate directly on application objects, in a ''Domain Driven Design'' way, without the need to write fixtures. 
 * The fixtures support various "graphical" values, including HTML lists and images. For example:
!|fitlibrary.specify.DoTree|

|check|tree|!-<ul><li>a</li><li>BB</li></ul>-!|
 * The fixtures avoid magic values in cells, such as "error"
For each of the ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures, we show some example tables and the corresponding fixture code. See the ^FitBook for further examples of ''!-FitLibrary-!''.
!3 Fixture for business processes (workflow):
 * ^DoFixture (some extensions)
!3 Fixtures for lists:
 * ^ArrayFixture for ordered lists
 * ^SetFixture for unordered lists
 * ^SubsetFixture for parts of unordered lists
 * ^ParamRowFixture to simplify the use of ''!-RowFixture-!'' with other ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures
 * ^ToStringArrayFixture for ordered lists of Strings (new)
!3 Fixture for calculations and constraints:
 * ^CalculateFixture
 * ^ConstraintFixture
 * ^CombinationFixture
!3 Fixture for set up:
 * ^SetUpFixture
!3 Fixtures for Domain Objects
See FitLibrarySpecifications for examples of these for now...
 * ^DomainObjectSetUpFixture (new)
 * ^DomainObjectCheckFixture (new)
!3 Fixture for comments
 * ^CommentFixture (new)
!3 Fixture for testing grids
 * ^GridFixture
 * ^ImageFixture is a subclass of ^GridFixture
!3 Fixture for comparing files and directories
 * ^FileCompareFixture
!3 Support for "Graphics"
Core Fit handles textual values in the cells of a table. These values are converted automatically into primitive values, such as 12, and into objects, such as a ''Date''.

The ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures also support "graphical" values:
 * ^TreeList uses HTML lists
 * ^ImageNameGraphic uses HTML image names
 * ^DotGraphics uses HTML images and associated Dot files
 * ^TaggedStrings retains the tags from within a table cell (the tags are usually discarded)
 * ^NestedTables provide support for embedded tables as values.
 * ^TaggedStrings ensure that HTML tags aren't removed from table cell contents (new in v2.0)
!3 ''!-FolderRunner-!''
 * ''^FolderRunner'' runs Fit tests. It handles test suites, organised in directories (folders). It can handle both HTML and XLS spreadsheet files.
 * It now uses css in the reports
!3 Support in Java, Python, C# and other languages
 * The Java ''!-FitLibrary-!'' now only works with the !-FitNesse-! version (ie, not the core Fit version). Java ''!-FitLibrary-!'' will be ported to Fit 2.0 as soon as that's available.
 * John Roth has added ''!-FitLibrary-!'' to the Python version of Fit (for both core Fit and FitNesse).
 * Mike Stockdale has released a C# port for much of ''!-FitLibrary-!'' at http://www.syterra.com/fitlibrary.net.20051122.zip
 * Randy Coulman has almost finished a port for Smalltalk
 * Work is underway on ports for Ruby and C++.
!3 Further Information
 * Further information will be made available at a new site over the next few months.
 * Many examples of the development of Fit tables using the core and the ''!-FitLibrary-!'' fixtures (v1.0), etc are covered in ''Fit for Developing Software'', Rick Mugridge and Ward Cunningham, Prentice-Hall, 2005.
