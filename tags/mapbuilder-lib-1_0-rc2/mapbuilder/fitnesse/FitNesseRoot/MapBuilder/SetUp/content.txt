Make sure that the host name/mapbuilder path is correct and pointing to where Mapbuilder is installed and running under Tomcat or equivalent. 
If you have installed the Mapbuilder war file in the Tomcat webapps directory of your local machine, the path would be http://localhost:8080/mapbuilder.  If you are debugger Mapbuilder running on a different server, adjust the path accordingly.
 
The sub-webapp is actually defaulted from the WEBAPP variable
It is overriden by every demo.  This is only used for manual tests and debugging of test fixtures
