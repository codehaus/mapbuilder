There are several changes to ''!-FitLibrary-!'':
!3 Storytest Writers
 * ''!-DoFixture-!'' special actions:
  * ''comment'' and ''ignored'' special actions to ignore tables
  * ''abandon storytest'' to ignore the rest of the storytest (without colouring it as ignored)
 * ''!-CommentFixture-!''
  * To ensure that a table is ignored, but not coloured
 * ''!-DomainObjectCheckFixture-!'' and ''!-DomainObjectSetUpFixture-!'' check and set up domain objects, respectively.
!3 ''!-FolderRunner-!''
 * Now works with the FitNesse version of Java Fit
 * It uses css for reports
!3 Programmers
 * The registered ''parse delegates'' are cleared at the end of each test, to avoid confusing cross-test interactions. If your tests now fail, it may be that you were depending on this previously.
 * The html tags in a table cell are retained with ''!-TaggedString-!''s
 * Missing method messages include possible method headers that can be copied and pasted directly into the code
 * ''!-FitLibrary-!'' now checks for ambiguity between a fixture class name, a special action and an ordinary method for an action. If there is more than one possible way of interpreting an action, an error is given. It ignores non-special methods inherited from the ''!-FitLibrary-!'' classes.
 * Providing details of expected results for test generation (such as UI tests with Selenium)

!1 Changes that are in progress (so they're not stable)
!3 User Guide
 * Will be reworked and extended with a task-based perspective ("How do I ...?") and a more complete reference
 * Here's the .FitNesse.FitLibrarySpecifications
!3 Storytest Writers
 * Entity References
 * Nested tables for setup and checking of domain objects and lists (sets to be provided later)
 * State-based extension of ''!-DoFixture-!'' that allows exactly the same table to be used in workflow storytests for setup or checking (ie, initial state or final state)
!3 Programmers
 * SUT chains
 * State pattern and ''!-DoFixture-!''. When a setup fixture is installed in the ''!-DoFixture-!'', all actions are delegated to it until the setup state is completed.
 * Optional logging of ''!-FitLibrary-!'' executing, to aid in debugging
