<h2>Other models</h2>


<p>
  A Web Map Context document is just one type of model supported.
  The configuration for this page demonstrates the mapbuilder 
  implementation for Context Collections.
  This is an XML document which contains a list of context document URLs and a title.
</p>

<div id="collectionList"></div>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td id="mainButtonBar" align="left" valign="top" width="18"/>
    <td id="mainMapPane"/>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The widget for a context Collection is a text listing of the map titles
  to be selected and is also generated by an XSL stylesheet.
  Other widgets could defined to support a dynamic menu system for example.
</p>

<p>
  In this case, the tools of the model are simply HTML links which execute
  a JavaScript method.  Note how the context model is set as the target of the 
  action using the &lt;tagetModelId&gt; property in the CollectionList widget.
  The links call the JavaScript config[targetModelId].loadModel(modelUrl) method.
</p>

<p>
  The MVC design pattern allows other document types to be supported very easily.
  Please see the mapbuilder-lib Software Design Description
  for details on how to extend the code base.
  This is an open source project so contributions from other developers are encouraged.
