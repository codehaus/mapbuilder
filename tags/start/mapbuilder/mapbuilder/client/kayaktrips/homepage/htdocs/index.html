<h2>About</h2>

<p><strong>"Show me the back streets of Sydney"</strong></p>

<p>Bicycle Riders in Sydney have a problem. The streets are narrow, congested
and hilly. There are plenty of back streets ideal for cycling, but working
out which streets connect and how to avoid the big hills is a black art.
Secret bike routes which include back alleys, drainage lines, and blocked off
streets are traded in dingy pubs between cyclists. While this is fun it is
also elitist and many people never consider riding because they don't realise
it is possible to cross the city safely on a bicycle.</p>

<p>What Sydney cyclists need is a map of Sydney bike routes. Some
organisations have tried to produce these maps, but they have all had their
limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An outside contractor is employed to develop the maps</li>
  <li>The maps are generally targeted at one level of bicycle use (either
    recreational, communter, experienced, amature, someone scared of traffic
    or not).</li>
  <li>The maps take so long to compile, they are out of date by the time they
    are in print, and do not get updated again for another 10 years or
  so.</li>
  <li>It is difficult and expensive to survey the public, and consequently
    only a few ideas are added to the map and many valuable routes are
  missed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The <em>Community Map Builder</em> provides a web page with a city map to
a cyclist. The cyclist can then enter their favourite bike route on top of
the map. Click, click, click, ... Submit. The bike route is collected from
the web page and sent to a bike map database. After hundreds of cyclists
enter their favourite bike routes, a comprehensive bike map of Sydney is
built, updated and maintained and given back to the cycling community.</p>

<p>This use case has been for my pet subject of bike paths, but it is equally
applicable for anyone wanting to collect geographic information from a lot of
people.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>This tool is something we would like to give to the global community - so
we are developing it as open source code, and aiming to stich in open source
components where available. </p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p><img src="HighLevelDesign.png" alt="high level design" /></p>

<h3>Data Entry Module</h3>

<p>This module will show a basemap, and allow a user to build a map feature
(like a bike track), give it attributes, and save it to the server.</p>

<p>This module should be simple to use so that many people will use it. Ie,
it should run in a web browser.</p>

<p>Currently, work in underway to enhance the geotools java applet to provide
the required functionality for this.  It is open source under the GPL.  See
<a
href="http://geotools.sourceforge.net">http//geotools.sourceforge.net</a></p>

<h3>Update Rules</h3>

<p>With lots of people maintaining the same database, we are going to need to
develop updating rules.  For example, if someone enters a bike path down the
center of a multilane freeway, who should be allowed to remove the entry?</p>

<p>For these rules we should allow users to moderate each other as has been
done very successfully with some news and comment sites like <a
href="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Transactional Web Feature Server / Geodatabase</h3>

<p>This will be a server which recieves update requests and updates a
geographic database. It will be designed according to the <em>Transactional
Web Feature Server</em> specification from the <em>Open GIS Consortium</em> -
<a href="http://opengis.org">http://opengis.org</a>.  At the time of writing,
this spec was in draft form and has not been released publicly, however there
are people working on this project who are members of the <em>Open GIS
Consortium</em> who have access to this document.</p>

<p>There are a few open source technologies which are looking promising in
this direction.</p>

<p>Postgresql is a free database - <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>, postgis -<a
href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a>,
is providing GIS search functionality into it.</p>

<p>Mapserv - <a
href="http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu">http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu</a> is another
potential candidate, especially using the mapscript interface it provides.</p>

<p>However, there is work required to get something up and running here.</p>

<h3>Map Viewer</h3>

<p>This is all that an end user will require to view the created maps.  The
end user will only need a web browser to view the created maps.</p>

<p>There are a few open source technologies available, geotools being a prime
candidate -  <a
href="http/geotools.sourceforge.net">http//geotools.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<h3>Web Map Server (WMS)</h3>

<p>This is generally how basemaps will be served to the web. The
specifications for the WMS are specified out by the <em>Open GIS
Consortium</em>.   It may also be how the maps created by the <em>Community
Map Builder</em> are served to the web.</p>

<p>Mapserv - <a
href="http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu">http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu</a> version 3.5
provides a good open source WMS.</p>

<p>There are already numourous maps being served to the web using WMS
protocols.  With a bit of luck, you will be able to find one which will be
useful for your Map Builder application.</p>

<h3>Open GIS Standards</h3>

<p>All  communications between components of the <em>Community Map
Builder</em> will use <a href="http://opengis.org">Open GIS Standards</a>. 
This means that any component or basemap can be replace with another when
required.</p>
