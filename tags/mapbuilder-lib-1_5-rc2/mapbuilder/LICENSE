It is the intent of this project that all Mapbuilder developers who
have been given write access to the Mapbuilder code repository and
have contributed to source code in mapbuilder/lib/* may become
copyright owners.

Providing a patch to the mailing list does not give someone the right to
become a copyright owner (primarily because it is too hard to track).

Once someone becomes a copyright owner, they do not loose this status
unless they personally request to be removed from the list of copyright
owners listed in this file.
