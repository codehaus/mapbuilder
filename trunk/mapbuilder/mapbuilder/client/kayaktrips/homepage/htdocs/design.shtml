<h1>Design</h1>

<p>The Community Map Builder is a framework with inter-changable components
which conform to <a href="http://opengis.org">Open GIS Standards</a>.  The
aim is to build up a full set of Open Source components, and then develop the
business logic to drive them.</p>

<h3>Data Entry Module</h3>

<p>This module will show a basemap, and allow a user to build a map feature
(like a bike track), give it attributes, and save it to the server.</p>

<p>This module should be simple to use so that many people will use it. Ie,
it should run in a web browser.</p>

<p>Currently, work in underway to enhance the geotools java applet to provide
the required functionality for this.  It is open source under the GPL.  See
<a
href="http://geotools.sourceforge.net">http//geotools.sourceforge.net</a></p>

<h3>Update Rules</h3>

<p>With lots of people maintaining the same database, we are going to need to
develop updating rules.  For example, if someone enters a bike path down the
center of a multilane freeway, who should be allowed to remove the entry?</p>

<p>For these rules we should allow users to moderate each other as has been
done very successfully with some news and comment sites like <a
href="http://slashdot.org">http://slashdot.org</a>.</p>

<h3>Transactional Web Feature Server / Geodatabase</h3>

<p>This will be a server which recieves update requests and updates a
geographic database. It will be designed according to the <em>Transactional
Web Feature Server</em> specification from the <em>Open GIS Consortium</em> -
<a href="http://opengis.org">http://opengis.org</a>.  At the time of writing,
this spec was in draft form and has not been released publicly, however there
are people working on this project who are members of the <em>Open GIS
Consortium</em> who have access to this document.</p>

<p>There are a few open source technologies which are looking promising in
this direction.</p>

<p>Postgresql is a free database - <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>, postgis -<a
href="http://postgis.refractions.net/">http://postgis.refractions.net/</a>,
is providing GIS search functionality into it.</p>

<p>Mapserv - <a
href="http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu">http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu</a> is another
potential candidate, especially using the mapscript interface it provides.</p>

<p>However, there is work required to get something up and running here.</p>

<h3>Map Viewer</h3>

<p>This is all that an end user will require to view the created maps.  The
end user will only need a web browser to view the created maps.</p>

<p>There are a few open source technologies available, geotools being a prime
candidate -  <a
href="http/geotools.sourceforge.net">http//geotools.sourceforge.net</a>.</p>

<h3>Web Map Server (WMS)</h3>

<p>This is generally how basemaps will be served to the web. The
specifications for the WMS are specified out by the <em>Open GIS
Consortium</em>.   It may also be how the maps created by the <em>Community
Map Builder</em> are served to the web.</p>

<p>Mapserv - <a
href="http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu">http://mapserv.gis.umn.edu</a> version 3.5
provides a good open source WMS.</p>

<p>There are already numourous maps being served to the web using WMS
protocols.  With a bit of luck, you will be able to find one which will be
useful for your Map Builder application.</p>

<h3>Open GIS Standards</h3>

<p>All  communications between components of the <em>Community Map
Builder</em> will use <a href="http://opengis.org">Open GIS Standards</a>.
This means that any component or basemap can be replace with another when
required.</p>
