<h2>The Vision</h2>

<p><em>"Show me the back streets of Sydne</em>y"</p>

<p>Bicycle Riders in Sydney have a problem. The streets are narrow, congested
and hilly. There are plenty of back streets ideal for cycling, but working
out which streets connect and how to avoid the big hills is a black art.
Secret bike routes which include back alleys, drainage lines, and blocked off
streets are traded in dingy pubs between cyclists. While this is fun it is
also elitist and many people never consider riding because they don't realise
it is possible to cross the city safely on a bicycle.</p>

<p>What Sydney cyclists need is a map of Sydney bike routes. Some
organisations have tried to produce these maps, but they have all had their
limitations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>An outside contractor is employed to develop the maps</li>
  <li>The maps are generally targeted at one level of bicycle use (either
    recreational, communter, experienced, amature, someone scared of traffic
    or not).</li>
  <li>The maps take so long to compile, they are out of date by the time they
    are in print, and do not get updated again for another 10 years or
  so.</li>
  <li>It is difficult and expensive to survey the public, and consequently
    only a few ideas are added to the map and many valuable routes are
  missed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>The <em>Community Map Builder</em> provides a web page with a city map to
a cyclist. The cyclist can then enter their favourite bike route on top of
the map. Click, click, click, ... Submit. The bike route is collected from
the web page and sent to a bike map database. After hundreds of cyclists
enter their favourite bike routes, a comprehensive bike map of Sydney is
built, updated and maintained and given back to the cycling community.</p>

<p>This use case has been for my pet subject of bike paths, but it is equally
applicable for anyone community wanting to collect geographic information
from a lot of people.</p>

<h2>Mixing large and small communities</h2>

<p>One beautiful thing about the web is that it has empowered small
individuals to publish along-side large news corporations, allowing users to
get both mainstream news and information alongside tailored specific
information that only a few people in the world are interested in.</p>

<p>The Community Map Builder aims to take this one step further by empowering
small communities to collect geographic data and publish it mixed with maps
built for large scale use.</p>

<p>For instance, a small mother's group could build a map of the children's
parks in their local area.  They can then view the parks on top of a detailed
streets basemap produced by the national mapping agency, as well as a weather
map produced by the Burea of Meteorology.</p>

<p>This will be achieved by ensuring each component within the Community Map
Builder is built to <a href="http://opengis.org">Open GIS Standards</a>,
allowing data and components to be mixed and matched.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>The Community Map Builder is something we would like to give to the global
community - so we are developing it as open source code, and aiming to stitch
in open source components where available.</p>

<p>I strongly suggest that maps built with the Community Map Builder are
given away for free in a similar manner.  It will encourage users to give you
their geographic knowledge if they know you are not going to be profiteering
from it as well as being good  for humankind as a whole.  For a list of
