mapbuilder-lib-1.5-alpha1
==========================
This Mapbuilder release adds a string of new features and developments to
the Mapbuilder core. While the core Mapbuilder functionality remains stable,
the new features should still be considered alpha; some new interfaces still
might change, the features have not been extensively tested and there are
still some major outstanding bugs.

Some of the new features include:

Compression:
The released version of Mapbuilder is now bundled up into one file and
compressed into half of its original size.

OWS Context:
Mapbuilder previously stored its LayerList in a Web Map Context (WMC) document.
A WMC describes a list of WMS layers. The latest Mapbuilder supports the
OGC's draft OWS Context specification which extends the WMC to include:
WFS layers, GeoRSS layers, GML Layers.

The OWS Context is rendered by the new MapPane2 and MapPaneOL widgets.
In the next release, we plan to deprecate MapPane2 and MapPane and replace them
by MapPaneOL.

Vector rendering using SVG/VML:
We now have SVG and VML rendering using MapPane and MapPaneOL. This rendering
is much faster than the previous WZGraphics library, however older browsers
will still need to revert the the WZGraphics library.

OpenLayers used for Rendering:
The MapPaneOL widget now uses OpenLayers for rendering. This means we can
easilly tap into OpenLayer's support for numerous map providers.
Eg: Tiled WMS, Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, MSN Maps, WFS, GML, etc.
We still haven't integrated the Mapbuilder tools with OpenLayer tools yet, but
that is expected to be completed for the next release.

SLD Editor:
We now have a Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) Editor example. A SLD describes
whether you map features should be rendered as red fat lines or blue thin
lines and you can apply styles to maps.

GeoRSS:
We have some GeoRSS examples which include rendering vector layers SVG/VML.

mapbuilder-lib-0.2-alpha (alpha quality)
========================================
This released is designed to provide a demonstration of a number of
features which have been developed since the last release.  The new
features are considered alpha quality and we suggest waiting for a future
release before using these features in a production product.

Extra functionality introduced in this release includes:
* Time series Web Map Service (WMS) client
* A gazateer (pull down list of placenames)
* GML Rendering
* Feature rendering from a Web Feature Service (WFS) query
* Feature entry to a Transactional Web Feature Service (WFS-T)
* Web Map Context (WMC) Editor client
* Javascript and XSL is now compressed to reduce downloads.

The schema for the configuration file has changed since last release
which means configuration files from release 0.1 will not work with 0.2.
Minor changes to the schema are expected for the next release.

Outstanding Issues (highest priority fist):
-------------------------------------------
1064707 GmlRender image does not move during a ZoomPan

1071242 Move util.js into JS objects

mapbuilder-lib-0.1 (beta quality)
=================================
This release has become very stable.  The only known issue of consequence is
that the pages take a long time to load over a slow connection without any user
feedback.  This is not a problem if you install mapbuilder-lib locally.

Outstanding Issues:
-------------------
962714 Slow load with no user feedback
964720 lat/long populated even when mouse is off widget

Issues addressed since last release:
------------------------------------
962718 Selection of Layers in Mozilla 1.5
963966 enabling tools from buttons
966438 Query image icon broken for relative directories
966436 Add Pan Tool
958878 AOI box larger than locator map
960701 AOI Box not visible at startup


mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc3 (beta quality):
======================================
* Added Reset button which resets to original area of interest
* Simplified the Main html page by moving the Javascript to Mapbuilder.js
* General cleanup and restructuring of Tools code

mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc2 (alpha quality):
=======================================
* Fixes showstopper bugs in IE relating to loading of scripts.
* Mapbuilder now takes a while to load because we force scripts to
  be loaded before rendering widgets.
* The reset button was commented out because it did not work on IE.

mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc1 (alpha quality):
=======================================
This initial version of Mapbuilder libraries contains:
* Web Map Server (WMS) client map.
* Building of a Map from a Web Map Context (WMC) document.
* Legend which turns layers on and off.
* Selection of an Area Of Interest by a locator map.
* Tools to Zoom in and out.
* The libraries have been tested on IE 6 and Mozilla 1.3 to 1.6.

The Mapbuilder Configuration file is expected to change in future
releases and it is not expected that future versions will be
backwardly compatable with this version (although the upgrade path
should be simple).
