mapbuilder-lib Release Information
==================================
$Id$

This file contains information about updates to each release:


mapbuilder-lib-0.2-alpha (alpha quality)
========================================
This released is designed to provide a demonstration of a number of
features which have been developed since the last release.  The new
features are considered alpha quality and we suggest waiting for a future
release before using these features in a production product.

Extra functionality introduced in this release includes:
* Time series Web Map Service (WMS) client
* A gazateer (pull down list of placenames)
* GML Rendering
* Feature rendering from a Web Feature Service (WFS) query
* Feature entry to a Transactional Web Feature Service (WFS-T)
* Web Map Context (WMC) Editor client

The schema for the configuration file has changed since last release
which means configuration files from release 0.1 will not work with 0.2.
Minor changes to the schema are expected for the next release.

Outstanding Issues:
-------------------
TBD:

mapbuilder-lib-0.1 (beta quality)
=================================
This release has become very stable.  The only known issue of consequence is
that the pages take a long time to load over a slow connection without any user
feedback.  This is not a problem if you install mapbuilder-lib locally.

Outstanding Issues:
-------------------
962714 Slow load with no user feedback
964720 lat/long populated even when mouse is off widget

Issues addressed since last release:
------------------------------------
962718 Selection of Layers in Mozilla 1.5
963966 enabling tools from buttons
966438 Query image icon broken for relative directories
966436 Add Pan Tool
958878 AOI box larger than locator map
960701 AOI Box not visible at startup


mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc3 (beta quality):
======================================
* Added Reset button which resets to original area of interest
* Simplified the Main html page by moving the Javascript to Mapbuilder.js
* General cleanup and restructuring of Tools code

mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc2 (alpha quality):
=======================================
* Fixes showstopper bugs in IE relating to loading of scripts.
* Mapbuilder now takes a while to load because we force scripts to
  be loaded before rendering widgets.
* The reset button was commented out because it did not work on IE.

mapbuilder-lib-0.1-rc1 (alpha quality):
=======================================
This initial version of Mapbuilder libraries contains:
* Web Map Server (WMS) client map.
* Building of a Map from a Web Map Context (WMC) document.
* Legend which turns layers on and off.
* Selection of an Area Of Interest by a locator map.
* Tools to Zoom in and out.
* The libraries have been tested on IE 6 and Mozilla 1.3 to 1.6.

The Mapbuilder Configuration file is expected to change in future
releases and it is not expected that future versions will be
backwardly compatable with this version (although the upgrade path
should be simple).
