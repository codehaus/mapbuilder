Community Map Builder Release Information
=========================================
$Id$

This file contains information about updates to each release:

r0_1 (alpha quality):
=====================
This initial version of Mapbuilder libraries contains:
* Web Map Server (WMS) client map.
* Building of a Map from a Web Map Context (WMC) document.
* Legend which turns layers on and off.
* Selection of an Area Of Interest by a locator map.
* Tools to Zoom in and out, and reset to original extent.

The Mapbuilder Configuration file is expected to change in future
releases and it is not expected that future versions will be
backwardly compatable with this version (although the upgrade path
should be simple).

This release does not contain any show-stopper bugs that we are
aware of.
