<h2>Other models</h2>


<p>
  A Web Map Context document is just one type of model supported.
  The <a href="/ql2/mbTutorial/tutorial4.xml" target="ConfigSrcWin">configuration</a> 
  for this page demonstrates the mapbuilder implementation for Context Collections.
  This is an XML document which contains a list of context document URLs and a title.
</p>

<p id="collectionList"></p>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td id="buttonBar" align="left" valign="top" width="18"/>
    <td id="firstMapPane"/>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  The widget for a context Collection is a text listing of a set of 
  maps to select from and is also generated by an XSL stylesheet.
  Other widgets could defined to support a dynamic menu system for example.
</p>

<p>
  In this case, the tools of the model are simply HTML links which execute
  a JavaScript method.  Note how the context model is set as the taget of the action
  using the &lt;tagetModelId&gt; property in the CollectionList widget.
  The links call the JavaScript config[targetModelId].loadModel(modelUrl) method.
</p>

<p>
  The MVC design pattern allows other document types to be supported very easily.
  Please see the mapbuilder <a href="/ql2/mb?page=reference#mapbuilder">design documentation</a> 
  for details on how to extend the code base.
  This is an open source project so contributions from other developers are encouraged.
