<h2>Simple map</h2>


<p>
  In it's most basic configuration, mapbuilder can be used to simply put a map
  in a web page.
</p>

<div id="mainMapPane" style="float:right;width:200"></div>

<p>
  The <a href="/ql2/mbTutorial/demos/tutorial1.xml" target="ConfigSrcWin">config file</a> 
  for this page consists of a single 
  model (a Web Map Context document) and a single widget (a MapPane).
</p>
<p>
  The ID assigned to the model is used to reference the methods and properties
  of the JavaScript model object as 'config[modelId]'.
</p>
<p>
  The model ID can also be used as an HTTP request parameter to initialize the 
  model from a URL.
  For example, 
  <a href="/ql2/mb?page=demos/tutorial1&mainMap=/mapbuilder/demo/context/modisWorld.xml">
  this page can be loaded with a different map.</a>
</p>

<p>
  The MapPane widget renders the model as a set of stacked images and 
  inserted into the page.  
  The widget ID in config is used to associate 
  the MapPane with an HTML page element, in this case a &lt;DIV&gt; element
  which has it's CSS style set to float on the right hand side of the page.
</p>
<p>
  The transformation is done by applying an XSLT stylehseet applied to the model.
