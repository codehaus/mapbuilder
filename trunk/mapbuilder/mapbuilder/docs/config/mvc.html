<h2>Model-View-Controller design pattern</h2>

<p>
A Mapbuilder configuration file closely follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
design pattern.
There are many descriptions of the MVC design pattern 
<a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=Model+View+Controller+design+pattern">available;</a>
a brief description of it as it applies to Mapbuilder is provided below.
It is a very useful design pattern for web applications because it provides
good separation between the information content, the presentation of that
information and the application state.
</p>

<p>
A <span class="regbld">Model</span> represents the information of the application,
typically in the form of an XML document retreived from a web service or in the
the form of a static file at a URL.
Models provide "get" methods to retrieve particular pieces of information or 
state and "set" methods to update the information and state of the model.
When set methods are used, views are notified of the change by calling 
listeners that can be registered with the model.
</p>

<p>
A <span class="regbld">View</span> is a representation of the information 
in a model.
Views can register themselves with a model to be notified of changes in the model
that may affect the view.
This is typically using "listener" callback methods which are called for 
various event types.
Views may also provide means to send user gestures (e.g. mouse clicks) to a 
controller.
In Mapbuilder, views are called widgets.
</p>

<p>
A <span class="regbld">Controller</span> translates interactions with the view 
into actions to be performed by the model.
Controllers modify the information and state of a model.
In Mapbuilder, views are called tools.
