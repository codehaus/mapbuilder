<h2>Skins, CSS and multilingual support</h2>

<p>
It's relatively easy to change the way your application looks, 
including the text and images output by the widgets.  
This is accomplished using a "skin" concept in addition to 
Cascading Stylesheets (CSS).
</p>

<h3>The skin directory</h3>
<p>
The skin directory is a property of the config file and points to a directory 
on the web server where images and other items coded into widget stylesheets
can be located.
The directory can be an absolute path or relative to the base directory
of the page being loaded.
</p>

<p>
Curently on Button images come from the skin dir, but all future Mapbuilder
extensions using images will come from this directory.
To create the URL for a button image, the button enabled/disabledSrc path
as appended to the skin directory.
This directory is also used as the root for the widget text file (see below).
