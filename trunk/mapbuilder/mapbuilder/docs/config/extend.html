<h2>Extending with new objects</h2>

<p>
The widgets and models provided in the Mapbuilder distribution are 
intended to meet most application requirements however they can't meet all 
requirements.
Fortunately the modular design makes it very easy to customize and extend 
to meet your requiremetns.
</p>

<p>
Both widgets and models can be specified in the config file using generic 
&lt;Widget&gt; and &lt;Model&gt; objects where no specialized 
JavaScript code is required.
The &lt;stylesheet&gt; property must be specified for generic Widget objects.
</p>

<p>
The widget &lt;stylesheet&gt; property can also be specified for any widget 
object to replace the stylesheet supplied in the Mapbuilder distribution.
The typical way to use this is to copy the default stylesheet into your 
application's directory and customize it as required, 
and setting the path to this new file in the config file.
