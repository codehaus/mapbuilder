<h2>Common properties in config</h2>

<p>
There are some object properties that are commonly used in the config file.
All common properties are optional and if they are missing, a reasonable default 
behaviour is provided.
Specific Objects may define additional properties and these may be required.

Every Object in the config file must have a unique ID assigned to it.
ID's are assigned to the objects as an attribute, not as a property.
