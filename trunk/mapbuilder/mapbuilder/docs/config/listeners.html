<h2>Listeners and object methods</h2>

<p>
More advanced applications will likely want to add functionality by
performing specific actions in response to user input.
There are a few methods provided in Mapbuilder to customize your application.
</p>

<p>
An important aspect of the MVC design pattern is that it is event driven.
Almost everything that happens over the course of the application execution
is the result of an event being triggered on a model, which then calls listener
functions registered with that model.
This allows the models, widgets and tools to remain independant of each other 
and makes Mapbuilder very modular - objects can be added and removed from the
configuration without affecting the other objects.
</p>

<p>
There is a global "config" object that can be referenced form anywhere.
You can retrieve a reference to all other objects by using the config.objects property.
For example, a model with an ID of "model_x" would be referenced as 
config.objects.model_x, or config.objects["model_x"].
</p>

<p>
The following methods can be called as the HREF element of an anchor tag:
<pre>
&lt;a href="javascript:config.loadModel(...)"/&gt;
</pre>
or as an event handler on any HTML element that allows it:
<pre>
&lt;td onclick="config.loadModel(...)"/&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>config.loadModel(modelId,docUrl)</dt>
<dd>This method will load the model with the specified <i>modelId</i> from
the <i>docUrl</i> provided.
This will also trigger a "loadModel" event for that model.
</dd>
<dt>model.setParam(param,value)</dt>
<dd>The HTTP method to use to retrieve the model.  Defaults to GET.
</dd>
<dt>model.setXpath(xpath,value)</dt>
<dd>The HTTP method to use to retrieve the model.  Defaults to GET.
</dd>
<dt>button action property</dt>
<dd>The HTTP method to use to retrieve the model.  Defaults to GET.
</dd>
</dl>
