<h2>Installing mapbuilder</h2>

<p>
The design philosophy of Mapbuilder is to minimize the server requirements,
but for a web application you will need a web server 
to serve your pages at a minimum.
(The exception to this is for applications that don't need to load XML
documents from outside the web, in which case you can also load
your application using the file:// protocol.
For example, try loading the simple demo by double clicking on the 
index.html file from a directory explorer view.)
</p>

<p>
There are 2 server side scripts that may be required, depending on your 
application.
Applications can be written so that these are not required at all;
the Simple demo is one example where all XML documents are served from the 
same domain and there is no "save" functionality in the page.
</p>
<ul> 
<li> a proxy script to bypass JavaScript security restrictions when loading 
documents that originate from a different domain than yours.
</li>
<li>a script used to write XML documents back to your server.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Mapbuilder is available as .zip file for use in a Apache/PHP environment, 
as well as a .war file for J2EE servlet containers like Jakarta Tomcat.
Installation is generally just a matter of expanding the archive into
the correct directory.
All server-side scripts are automatically available by installing the appropriate
archive.
More details on each environment are available in the following pages.
</p>

<dl class="med">
  <dt class="title">Tomcat environment:</dt>
  <dd>
  Download the xxx-war.zip archive and extract the mapbuilder.war file to the tomcat webapps
  directory. 
  Depending on your Tomcat setup, you may or may not have to restart Tomcat, 
  the default tomcat setup will expand the .war file automatically.
  Installation details for other servlet containers may vary.
  <dd>
  <dt class="title">Apache/PHP environment</dt>
  <dd>
  Download the mapbuilder zip file and unpack it into a web accessible directory.
  With Apache this will be the htdocs directory.
  Installation details for other web servers may vary.
  </dd>

  You should then be able to try it out from this URL:
