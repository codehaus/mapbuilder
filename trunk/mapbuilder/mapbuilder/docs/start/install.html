<h2>Installing mapbuilder</h2>

<p>
Mapbuilder is available as .zip file for use in a Apache/PHP environment, 
as well as a .war file for J2EE servlet containers like Jakarta Tomcat.
</p>

<dl class="med">
  <dt class="title">Tomcat environment:</dt>
  <dd>
<p>
  Download the mapbuilder.war file and put it in the tomcat webapps
  directory. Restart tomcat.
</p>
<p>
  The required server side scripts are automatically available as servlets,
  and configured in /mapbuilder/WEB-INF/web.xml.
  By default, these are: /mapbuilder/proxy for the proxyUrl property and 
  /mapbuilder/writeXml for the serializeUrl config property.
  Make sure that these properties of MapbuilderConfig are set correctly in 
  your configuration file.
</p>
<p>
  Installation details for other servlet containers may vary.
</p>
  <dd>
  <dt class="title">Apache/PHP environment</dt>
  <dd>
<p>
  Download the mapbuilder zip file and unpack it into a web accessible directory.
  With Apache this will be the htdocs directory.
  Installation details for other web servers may vary.
</p>
<p>
  The required server side scripts are available as: 
  /mapbuilder/server/proxy/proxy.php for the proxyUrl property and 
  (not yet implemented) for the serializeUrl config property.
  Make sure that these properties of MapbuilderConfig are set correctly in 
  your configuration file.
