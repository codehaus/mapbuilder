<h2>Coding your web page</h2>

<p>
When developing an application, keep it separate from the 
mapbuilder codebase so that you can update your mapbuilder installation
without affecting your application.  
Customization of the widgets is done through the stylesheet property, when
required.
The only requirement is that mapbuilder and your application must share the
same domain name.
</p>

<p>
There are several common steps for coding a mapbuilder application.  
In the following code examples, paths starting with "/" are relative
to your server root, otherwise they are relative to the web page's base URL.
</p>

<ol class="med">
  <li><span class="title">Create the HTML for the web page:</span>
  All that is required is to assign an ID attribute to the HTML elements in the
  page where mapbuilder widget output will be inserted.
  For example:
  <pre>&lt;div&nbsp;id="mbId"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  where "mbId" corresponds to a widget ID in your configuration file.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Create your mapbuilder configuration file:</span>
  Copy an existing configuration file or create a new one.
  Adjust the URL of models to point to the documents you wish to load.
  Then include the widgets desired, setting
  it's ID attribute to the corresponding HTML element in your page.
  Finally, add in any tools desired.
  Reference the configuration file in the web page's &lt;HEAD&gt; element
  (before including the library in the next step).  This variable must be named
  exactly as specified here.
  <pre>
    &lt;script&gt;
      // URL of Mapbuilder configuration file.
      var mbConfigUrl='config/contextEditor.xml';
    &lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Include the mapbuilder Javascript library:</span>
  the web page's &lt;HEAD&gt; element must include a reference to the mapbuilder
  library JavaScript code.  The library must be installed on the same server as 
  the page using it:
  <pre>
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/mapbuilder/lib/Mapbuilder.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Initialize the application:</span>
  the page's BODY onload event handler must call mapbuilder's body onload event 
  handler. 
  <pre>
  &lt;body onload='mbDoLoad()'&gt;
    ..rest of page body...
  &lt;/body&gt;
  <pre>
  </li>

</ol>
