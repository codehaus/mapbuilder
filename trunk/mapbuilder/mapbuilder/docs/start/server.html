 
<h2>Server requirements</h2>

<p>
While the design philosphy of mapbuilder is to minimize server requirements,
there are some cases where you have to modify your server configuration or
provide server CGI/script processing.
<ul>
  <li><span class="title">XML mime types:</span>
    The XML documents you retrieve must have a mime type of "text/xml".
    File types that typically aren't served with that mime type include 
    context documents (.cml), collections (.ccml) 
    and often XSL files as well (.xsl).
    Check that the mime type mapping file for your server contains a line like:
    <pre>text/xml      xml xsl cml ccml</pre>
    If you are using Apache, this file will be specified in the httpd.conf.
  </li>
  <li><span class="title">Proxy script:</span>
    By default, you can only load XML documents served from a server in
    the same domain as your web page.
    If you want to be able to load XML documents from anywhere on the Internet, 
    you will have to install a proxy loader script on your server to make it 
    look like these documents come from your domain.  
    Implementations of this script for the PHP, Perl and
    JSP server environments are available in the mapbuilder distribution in 
    /mapbuilder/server subdirectory.
  </li>
</ul>
