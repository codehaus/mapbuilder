<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Mapbuilder is an open source project that provides a client-side solution for 
dynamically generating web page content from XML documents.
It is a JavaScript library that implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design 
pattern in the browser.
</p>

<p>
Mapbuilder was originally conceived to render 
<a href="?page=reference#ogc">Web Map Context documents</a> as 
specified by the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) in web pages, however the modular design
allows mapbuilder to be extended to handle almost any XML document type.
</p>

<p>
One design goal of mapbuilder is to let page designers do page layout
and design, and simply link in mapbuilder JavaScript code using HTML element IDs. 
Being a JavaScript implementation, CSS and DHTML techniques are used for
manipulating these elements.
</p>

<p>
This tutorial explains how to configure and link mapbuilder components into a web page.
Several different mapbuilder configurations will be demonstrated along with some
ideas for how to include it in the web page layout.
The target audience for this tutorial is those tasked with implementing an 
application in HTML.
Developer's seeking to extend or modify the code-base should consult 
the mapbuilder <a href="?page=reference#mapbuilder">design documentation.</a> 
</p>

<p>
The mapbuilder components to be used in a page are specified in an
XML configuration file.  
The schema of the configuration file is derived from RDF and is fully described 
in the <a href="?page=config/config">mapbuilder configuration documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
The tutorial starts with the common steps required to code a mapbuilder
application.
